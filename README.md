## Features:

Stores data using Maps and Multimaps that are built on B+Trees

It keeps track of things like individual indices, lists of indices, and lists of keywords

For saving table records, the program uses binary files

It uses text files to remember information (table history) like table names, field names, and the number of records so that everything is still available the next time the program is run

A state machine (built using an adjacency matrix) is used to handle the grammar and interpret commands entered by the user

Includes a batch mode: the constructor takes a file name (a text file) as an argument and executes the commands within
